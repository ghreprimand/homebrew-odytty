# Canonical source for the `odytty` Homebrew source-build formula.
#
# The tap (`ghreprimand/homebrew-odytty`) holds its own git repository; this
# copy is the upstream template. On each release tag the `homebrew` job in
# .github/workflows/release.yml stamps the `url` version and `sha256` from the
# published release, then pushes the updated formula (and the cask) to the tap.
#
# This builds the CLI binary from the published GitHub release source tarball —
# the same `git archive` tarball the AUR package and the Release workflow use.
# A locally compiled binary is never quarantined, so it launches without a
# Gatekeeper warning on any supported macOS (including Intel), which is why the
# formula is the fallback for arches the prebuilt arm64 cask does not target.
# The `.app` bundle is the cask's job; the formula ships only the CLI binary.
